These should probably use the issue tracker on GitHub, but this will do for now...

Known issues/areas for improvement:

- the test for what version of lynx is in use won't work on most older platforms, making it of limited use.
 - Also, the "close enough" copy/paste hack of code off Stack Overflow is inappropriate. It should be code
  that this project has a license to use, AND it should actually solve the problem.
- JUMPFILE won't add the new features if a jumpfile already exists.
- jumpfiles and functions should be automatically generated from one set of source material so the same thing doesn't need to be added/changed in three places.
 - Also, the ? shortcut should work for any $ALIAS_LYNX_PATH
 - Ideally, we'd detect the existing jumpfile, add appropriate new links to it, and then sort them correctly.
  - Oooh, if they upgrade lynx, we ought to replace static jumpfile links with searchable ones automatically.
 - searchable jumpfiles could have full DDG bang integration - just parse https://duckduckgo.com/bang.v236.js
- A recent Cygwin update removes the default SSL certificates file. A fix for making that work out of the box would be handy. Or not, if it means having to handle certs and revocations...

- redirect "automatically refresh" pages are too slow - can they be configured to be automatic (or at least faster?)
- need to find a smoother way to handle cookie preferences...maybe a "deny unless I say otherwise" instead of a "prompt every time".
